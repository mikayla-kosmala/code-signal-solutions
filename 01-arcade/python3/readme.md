<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->
<h2 align="left">About The Repository</h2>
<p align="center">
   This is all about Python3 solutions for Arcade Challenges on Code Signal. I added custom test and master variable files to this repo in case anyone wanted to tryout their functions against my tests. I made my tests a bit more rigorous and let the user know what went wrong.
</p>

<h3 align="left">File Layout</h3>
<p align="left">
   Each challenge has it's own file. In each file is the following (in order):
   <ul>
        <li align="left">The description of the challenge at the time of solving</li>
        <li align="left">First attempt</li>
        <li align="left">Best solution using google</li>
        <li align="left">Rigorous solution</li>
    </ul>
    Each solution/attempt will have a description of how I came up with the solution below the function.
