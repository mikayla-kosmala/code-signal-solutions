"""
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain
 a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if 
a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

Example:
For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be solution(sequence) = false.

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be solution(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence 
[1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

The function above worked for all the free tests, but exceded the time limit exceeded for the hidden tests
which means we need to computationally improve our formula. I couldn't think of a way to do it without googling.

The idea behind this was to remove each element in the list and then check to see if it is strictly asscending
