<h3 align="center">Code Signal Solutions and Explanations</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Code Signal is a great place to enhance coding skills and understand the basics of any of the coding languages code signals provides. I am here to help others and myself understand these challenges better. I plan on only going through the python solutions, but might take a stab at the C# or C++ challenges as well.

<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->
<h2 align="left">About The Repository</h2>
<p align="center">
   How much is staying at your rental property worth? This can be a tricky number to set in 2022 with people antsy after the 2020 pandemic, the housing market rising to new highs, etc. This app is built to help hosts predict the price of their daily rate during the all seasons of the year. As people who have stayed at rentals on several occasions we take into account as much as possible when in comes to what your potential guests will look at and set an optimal price for your rental.
